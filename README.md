# TradeBot
Automated trading bot for crypto currency (Bitfinex)

I am NOT a programmer by any means.  I wanted to develop an automated trading bot to make money based on volatility, not long term trading.
None of my programmer friends would help me, so this is the result of a month of coding on PHP.  

I ran this bot via a console php (on windows with PHP installed, run cmd.exe, then type "php tradebot.php").  Or, you can make a batch
file like I did, to re-run this every so many seconds.  

I will say flat out -- the error checking I developed is complete garbage... it just checks to see if anything was returned... if no data
was returned, it's considered an error.  In a couple checks, if the wrong header was returned, it's considered an error.  

Anyways, I ran this bot, making profitable trades, then BitFinex decided to cease trading operations for any traders in the U.S.A...
so, my bot is now useless.  I may or may not port it to another exchange, however, I've decided to give it away for anyone interested.

I am NOT AT ALL liable if you lose money using this bot.  I've clearly stated that I am NOT a programmer... and you're deciding to use my
bot, so good luck.  I'll update this readme soon enough.
